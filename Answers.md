## What makes React Native apps different from hybrid apps built with Cordova and the like?
    They compile down so they can be run natively on either iOS or Android. Doesn't have to be platform specific. React Native accesses various things from a phone like the camera, microphone, and GPS without needing specific information about those things on each phone.

## In what ways is React Native different syntactically from React?
    React uses common HTML elements (like <Div>) and css and therefore is written like a combination of JS, HTML, and CSS. React Native uses its own thing (like <View>) based off of flex boxes and requires Javascript syntax for CSS. 

## What are some draw backs of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages?
    React Native doesn't perform as well with high processing. Some super specific tasks can't been done due to the simplicity.

## What are some of the strengths of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages?
    React Native is very fast to write on and very readable. Mostly don't have to worry about iOS vs. Android issues. Can easily use native components from iOS/Android like buttons, tabs, sliders, on-off switches, and other native UI and functional components. Makes it a lot easier to have a professional looking application.
