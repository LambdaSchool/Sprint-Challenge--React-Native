1. React native has JavaScript code interfacing with the native components of the underlying platform. Allows for great code reusability. 

2. React native doesn't use HTML. Instead of <p> we use <Text> and instead of <div> we use <View>.

3. React Native is generally slower than native platforms. 

4. You don't need to learn a new language in order to get a mobile app up and running because at the end of the day- React Native is just JavaScript. One Language to rule them all.
