1. The goal of RN is not to provide a way to write once and run everywhere. Rather, they want developers to use the components which best follow the native behaviors of the platform. React Native is based on the Javascript framework React and, thus, uses Javascript code that resembles HTML. With React Native you see the result of your modifications as you make them. No need to recompile, rebuild, etc.; React Native renders native view. Since all views are Native, the performance will be much better.

2. React-Native doesnâ€™t use HTML to render the app, but provides alternative components that work in a similar way. Most components provided can be translated to something similar in HTML, where for example a View component is similar to a div tag, and a Text component is similar to a p tag. To style your React-Native components, you will have to create stylesheets in Javascript. The Navigator component is an alternative to react-router.

3. Disadvantages of React Native for developers: 
  * Novelty. Developers need to carefully study the documentation that is attached to the updated version of this framework to make sure it is compatible with the previously created APIs.
  * Possible difficulties in renewing licenses when obtaining patents for derived software.
  * Lesser performance.
  * The need to attract native developers. The implementation of some advanced activities, such as access to device sensors, camera or push-notifications, requires acute platform knowledge and, in some cases, this involves IT companies having to involve native developers.

4. React Native Advantages for Developers:
  * Ease of learning.
  * Ability to develop cross-platform applications for iOS and Android.
  * Simplified user interface design. React Native app development employs the declarative coding, making the order of action implementation unimportant.
  * Support for rapid development iterations. There is no need to upload the updated application to an emulator or physical device each time.
  * No problems launching media in the browser.
