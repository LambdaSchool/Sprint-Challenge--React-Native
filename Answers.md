## Questions & Answers
1. What makes React Native apps different from hybrid apps built with Cordova and the like?
    - React Native apps are different from hybrid apps because, from my understanding, they are not compatible with every platform. For example, if we were to write a HTML/CSS and run it, it would be able to run on almost everything nearly the same whereas React Native will not. By creating something through React Native, you will not create a 'mobile web app' but instead an actual mobile app.

2. In what ways is React Native different syntactically from React?
    - React Native uses native components instead of web components. A key difference I noticed is how we are using different types of tags and elements. I have been using the `<View></View>` tag quite often in RN but in React, that tag could be equivalent to a `<div></div>`.

3. What are some draw backs of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages?
    - Some drawbacks are that, from my personal experience, React Native has been quite difficult to customize in it's front end. Also, I had to learn React Native since I have never heard of it.

4. What are some of the strengths of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages?
    - Some strengths of writing a mobile app in React Native is that it is quite fast and lets us re-use containers. Since it is quite similar to React, the learning curve for me was a little bit better.
