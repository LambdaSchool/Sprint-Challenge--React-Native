1. React native allows you to build native components as well as interface with api's and capabilities of the device. Hybrid apps run inside of a webview, which is a native component used for accessing a website from within an app.

2. React Native is different syntactically because the method of styling is slightly different from writing css and the components used to build a page are entirely different from DOM elements. 

3. With React native we can be slightly limited based on the tools available. Without being able to write native code ourselves, we must rely on the community of developers that have built bridges between certain native features and react native. Ex: Webrtc, push notifications, geolocation, background images/gradients, playing sounds, playing video, etc.

4. Writing an app in React native is a great experience. The development flow is fast as can be, integrating native code is a breeze, one can write for android and ios simultaineously, and riding the wave of Javascript's platform-dominance allows one to write their api, webapp, and native app entirely in javascript.
