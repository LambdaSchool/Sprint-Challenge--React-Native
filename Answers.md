## What makes React Native apps different from hybrid apps built with Cordova and the like?

- IT OFFERS THIRD-PARTY PLUGIN COMPATIBILITY, LESS MEMORY USAGE, AND A SMOOTHER EXPERIENCE.
- Whereas native app development is usually associated with inefficiency, less developer productivity, and slower time to deployment, React Native is all about bringing the speed and agility of web app development to the hybrid space—with native results.

Under React Native’s hood is Facebook’s popular ReactJS UI library for web applications. React Native brings all of ReactJS’s better app performance, DOM abstraction, and simplified programming methods to hybrid mobile development.

- React Native is focused solely on building a mobile UI. Compared with JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS or MeteorJS, React Native is UI-focused, making it more like a JavaScript library than a framework. The resulting UI is highly responsive and feels fluid thanks to asynchronous JavaScript interactions with the native environment. This means the app will have quicker load times than a typical hybrid app, and a smoother feel.

- If you know JavaScript, React Native is a quick pick-up, essentially allowing any front-end web developer to be a mobile developer on the spot. No need to learn iOS’s Swift or Java for Android—just know JavaScript, some native UI elements, platform APIs, and any other platform-specific design patterns and you’re good to go. Also included in React Native’s library are Flexbox CSS styling, inline styling, debugging, and support deploying to either the App Store or Google Play.

React is still new, but it’s maturing quickly and Facebook has stated it plans to continue investing in its growth.

- This is a huge bonus for businesses that want to augment an existing app but don’t want to overhaul it. Incorporate React Native components into your app’s code. Or, if your existing hybrid app was built with Cordova and Ionic, reuse that Cordova-based code easily with a plugin. Apply React Native UI components to an existing app’s code—without any rewriting at all.

- It's got IOS and Android covered. Initially, Facebook only developed React Native to support iOS. However with its recent support of the Android operating system, the library can now render mobile UIs for both platforms. Facebook used React Native to build its own Ads Manager app, creating both an iOS and an Android version. Both versions were built by the same team of developers.

Facebook also made React Native open-source, with the idea that compatibility with other platforms like Windows or tvOS could be worked on by the development community, so stay tuned.



## In what ways is React Native different syntactically from React?

- View tags instead of divs, since their is no Browser Document Object Model

## What are some draw backs of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages?

- Does not support All API's
- Less tools compared to native
- Facebook could end React-Native and people would need to go back to native anyway


## What are some of the strengths of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages?

- One Code Base
- Faster to product/market
- Web Developers become mobile developers too
- Hot Reloading
- Open Source
