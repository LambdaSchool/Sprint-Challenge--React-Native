1. We can create both iOS and Android apps using React Native.
In React Native we run JS code, but when it comes to UI it renders native OS code.

2. First - Tags. <View>, <Text>, <Image> etc.
Second - some functions like onPress.

3. Probably compiling time. When we have a lot of codes written in JS it takes too long to translate all the code to native OS language code - Java or objective C.

4. We can integrate Redux. Redux makes React Native more simple to use. Instead of passing props from Parent to Child components we could connect redux store directly to the component.
