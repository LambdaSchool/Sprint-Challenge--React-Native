## Questions
1. What makes React Native apps different from hybrid apps built with Cordova and the like?
  React native is built upon React while Cordovo apps utilizes WebView which is a single page app integrated into the web browser which means it is not tied to a specific framework or library. However, React native apps tend to be much more responsive while Cordovo apps may have more problems such as missing visual feedback fors taps and clunkier scrolling.
2. In what ways is React Native different syntactically from React?
   There is no Dom on React Native and which means it does not use the standard index.html file for managing the app and its components. Everything is usually done inside the App.js file. This also means that you do not use the same tags as you would in your typical Html 5 and React app. 
3. What are some draw backs of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages?
   As mentioned eariler, the biggest drawback is that it utilizes heavily on the React framework so if you do not like the React framework, you will also by extension will not be a fan of the React Native framework. It is also harder to rewrite existing desktop web app into a React native app. Even React apps cannot simply become a React native apps with a few simple clicks even though they share so many commonalities including the same React framework. This is because as mentioned earlier React native has no dom, and utilizes different syntax from HTML.
4. What are some of the strengths of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages?
   One of the strengths is that while it is different from React in the sense it doesn't have a dom or index.js file, it does pretty much utilizes the React framework so it comes with all the benefits that come with using React including responsiveness, speed and being able to use the Javascript language. Other native languages tend to be slower, less responsive, and a live reload which allows you to immediately see the result of the latest change in your code.
