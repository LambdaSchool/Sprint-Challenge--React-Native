1. React Native is different because of the 'React' style approach. Things like using Components to make your code reusable. Another main thing is React native renders native views. So it doesnt use webviews

2. React native is synatically different in that instead of using the same terms as in jsx. it uses different ones. (<div> becomes <View>)

3. Some draw backs: it does not support all apis, the designs are different for android and iphone apps so you might have to do a like of if statements checking for which device, Facebook could stop updating react native

4. One code base for iphone and android apps, easy to transition between web and mobile apps since they are both JavaScript base, it is open sourced
