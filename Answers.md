What makes apps built with React Native different from hybrid style apps built with Cordova/Ionic?
Ionic/Cordova have advanced GUI and CLI that come with inumerable nu,ber of plugins. App is implemented by wrapping in to the shell that tranforms HTML code into Javascript.
React Native is a comprehensive Javascript framework outsourced by facebook. Unlike Cordova/Ionic, React native uses components to develop its framework, transcended into Javascript code. Thus it does not need web browsing type of middleware to tranform its' content from HTML to JS! Additionaly Ionic has to be wrapped with Webview, and needs required plugin in order for it to be function on mobile platform.

In what ways is React Native different syntactically from React?
React Native is a framework and React is a Javascript library. Thus we need to bundle up our code with the help of Webpack. RN also does not render HTML, rather it makes use of its' on built in categories that replace the use of HTML tags. And stysheets are different than CSS of that of react! Additionaly React Native offers better platform tools, developer tools, navigation options, and with its help ypu can incorporate varied animations.



What are some of the strengths of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages? 
The apps developed in native languages make it imperitive for a developer to be proficient in that native language. As a result, there are many available libraries and source code that can be easilt borroed , or it can also make debuggig easy. It also means that the code must be re-rendered and re written in order to release it on the platform. RN on the other hand can easily be pushed on any platform without making much changes. Its also faster and dynamic making it less time consuming!

What is are some differences between localStorage and AsyncStorage? What are some similarities between the two?
They both give you ability to maintain data between app starts. However AsynchStorage come built in with RN. Thus it does not require additional framework or setup.  The local storage accepts dynamic values whereas AsynchStorage only accepts strings as value. Thus it takes an extra effort to convert all the data to make it applicable for AsynchStorage. Local storage is usuful when the data quantity is huge.
