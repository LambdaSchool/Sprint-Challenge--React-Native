Questions:

1. Many people in the class have been tinkering around in the web dev space before they came to LS. I did not. I worked in a completely different industry. I have never used Cordova, and we were not taught about Cordova, nor asked to research it. I do not know the difference.

(I am deep in the weeds on my project and want to get back to it. I've only gotten to work on my own stuff for the first time this week and I've been storing many ideas in my head and I'm trying to get them all out.)

2. React Native uses a different package than React. (I assume this question is referring to the differences between how HTML JSX is handled and how React Native JSX is handled). View, Text, TextInput, FieldList, SectionList are some of the alias for what would be div, text, input, ul in HTML. (Again, I barely know that much html. I did not work in web dev before coming to LS).

3. No idea. I can guess, but I have no clue how React Native works under the hood. I don't know what it transpiles/compiles to. Nor can I compare that to Swift/Java for iOS/Android development. (I have no background in mobile development).

4. There are a couple benefits for writing mobile apps with react native instead of native code. Most benefits seem to revolve around the cost and time saving element for dev teams. Benefits might include: 1. Familiar code structure for developers - easier adoption and up skilling. 2. Devs can write their code in React Native and deploy both iOS/Android apps - "two birds, one stone".

Feedback: Also, I haven't had time to really look into react-native and I'm rusty with react, haven't touched it in a while. There's no way I can build it without referencing something. My mind is deep in the weeds for my own project - trying to get all my ideas out and figure this out. I've been under motivated and tired of doing labs (since client-auth) and really want to work on finally writing down and getting thoughts out for my own project.
