# Assessment for Mobile development with React Native
* Answers to your written questions will be recorded in *Answers.md* 
* This is to be worked on alone but you can use outside resources. You can *reference* any old code you may have, and the React Documentation, however, please refrain from copying and pasting any of your answers. Try and understand the question and put your responses in your own words. Be as thorough as possible when explaining something. 
* **Just a friendly Reminder** Don't fret or get anxious about this, this is a no-pressure assessment that is only going to help guide you here in the near future. This is NOT a pass/fail situation. 
## Start by forking and cloning this repository.
## Questions
1. What makes React Native apps different from hybrid apps built with Cordova and the like?
2. In what ways is React Native different syntactically from React?
3. What are some draw backs of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages?
4. What are some of the strengths of writing a mobile app in React Native versus the other native languages?

## Project
* You will be writing a simple app that makes a GET request to https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all and lists all the breed names of dogs. I would suggest making a get request with Postman first so that you know the structure of the data coming back. You may use axios or whatever your preference is. You can also check out their documentation at https://dog.ceo/dog-api/.

## Stretch Problem
* Create a second View that displays the sub breeds of a given breed. Use React Navigation to create a clickable link on those breeds that have sub breeds in order to achieve this.
